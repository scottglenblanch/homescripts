This is base scripts that I like to use

Feel free to download or fork this project

To get running

1.) Download from github repository. I recommend adding this to your 'home' directory, located at ~

2.) Make all files executable. 
Command for this if downloaded in home directory is...
chmod -R +x ~/homescripts

3.)Then in either ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile depending on which script interpreter you are using
add the following

source ~/homescripts/commands/homescripts-init
